# 🌐 HTML Basics – My Web Development Kickstart

This repository contains all the basic HTML files I created while learning the fundamentals of web development.

## 📚 What I Learned

Through hands-on practice, I covered:
- Basic HTML structure (`<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`)
- Text formatting tags (`<h1>` to `<h6>`, `<p>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`)
- Lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`)
- Links and images (`<a>`, `<img>`)
- Tables and forms
- Semantic tags (`<header>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, etc.)
- Organizing code with indentation and comments

## 💡 Why This Repo

I wanted to track my progress, keep everything organized, and make it easier to look back as I move forward. This is the first step in my journey into web development — more to come as I continue learning!

## 📌 My Approach

- Practiced each concept by writing small example files.
- Learned by doing — breaking and fixing code helped me understand it better.
- Committed regularly using Git to track my changes and get used to version control early.

## 🛠️ What's Next

I’ll soon move on to:
- CSS for styling
- JavaScript for interactivity
- Building mini projects with what I’ve learned

🧠 _This might be simple, but it’s where real learning begins. Every tag and line of code here was written with curiosity and consistency._
